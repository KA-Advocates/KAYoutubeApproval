This script attempts to automatically login with a couple of Youtube accounts in order to approve subtitle and title translations. Obviously, you should be using this only if sure that the translations have been edited and approved elsewhere.

1. Install NodeJS latest version (https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
2. Extract or copy the contents of this repository in a folder
3. In the terminal (Command Prompt for Windows), navigate to this folder and run 'npm install' to install dependencies
4. You will need to download the chromedriver for your OS and your Chrome version from https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads and put it in the directory of the script
  NOTE: If using Windows, you will not be able to run this from the WSL terminal. You must use the Windows terminal (or any converter like GIT bash, MSYS, etc)
5. Put the list of video files in videos.csv, one URL on a line
6. Fill config.csv with your Youtube account(s)
7. Open looksgood.js and change "LANGUAGE" to your preferred locale (note, only Bulgarian/bg is tested with the UI)
8. Back in the terminal, run the script with 'node looksgood.js videos.csv'. Optionally, add the '--no-headless' parameter at the end in order to see what the script is doing.
