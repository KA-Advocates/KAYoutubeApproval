This script attempts to automatically login with a couple of Youtube accounts in order to approve subtitle and title translations. Obviously, you should be using this only if sure that the translations have been edited and approved elsewhere. NOTE that as of late 2019 Youtube have mandated that only the Khan Academy account owners can do this, so the script might already be irrelevant. If this solution is reversed, it can probably still be used.

1. Install NodeJS latest version & yarn or npm
2. On the terminal, run 'npm install' or 'yarn install' to install dependencies
3. You need to download the chromedriver for your OS and your Chrome version from https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads and put it in the main folder

NOTE: If using Windows, you will not be able to run this from the WSL terminal. You must use the Windows terminal (e.g. GIT Bash, Powershell, or anything)

4. Put the list of video files in videos.csv, one URL on a line
5. Fill config.csv with your Youtube account(s)
6. Open looksgood.js and change "LANGUAGE" to your preferred locale (note, only Bulgarian/bg is tested with the UI)
7. Run the script with 'node looksgood.js videos.csv'. Optionally, add the '--no-headless' parameter at the end in order to see what the script is doing.
